# Vig-Giscus

A comments system powered by **GitHub Discussions**. Let visitors leave comments and reactions on your website via GitHub! Heavily inspired by **utterances**.

## Configuration

Choose the repository giscus will connect to. Make sure that:

1. The **repository is [public](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility#making-a-repository-public)**, otherwise visitors will not be able to view the discussion.
2. The **[giscus](https://github.com/apps/giscus) app is installed**, otherwise visitors will not be able to comment and react.
3. The **Discussions feature is turned on** by [enabling it for your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/enabling-or-disabling-github-discussions-for-a-repository).
